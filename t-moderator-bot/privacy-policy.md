> ## What data does T_Moderator_Bot collect?
We try our best to collect as less data as possible, while providing the best experience possible.
The point of using this data is to provide a better experience to the user using the bot.
We try to implement a lot of useful functions for every Discord Server to use based on their daily needs!
You can learn more about what we collect down below.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| User IDs | Used for storing in-bot economy balance, user profile, leveling data and user warnings. |
| Economy | Essential to provide the actual user balance back to the user.
| Bot Profile | Enough to load a user's in-bot profile! |
| Leveling | To display the activity of a user on a Discord Server! |
| Moderation | Logging actions such as warnings and mutes if a log channel is set. |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings/customized bot behavior. |
