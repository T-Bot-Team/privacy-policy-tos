### What data does T_Moderator_Bot collect?
We try our best to collect as less data as possible, while providing the best experience possible.
The point of using this data is to provide a better experience to the user using the bot.
We try to implement a lot of useful functions for every Discord Server to use based on their daily needs!
You can learn more about what we collect down below.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| User IDs | Used for storing in-bot economy balance and user profile, along with leveling data and user warnings. |
| Economy | Essential to provide the actual user balance back to the user.
| Pre-Configured Profile Description/Footer/Color | Enough to load a user's in-bot profile! |
| Leveling | To display the activity of a user on a Discord Server! |
| Moderation | Logging actions such as warnings and mutes to make moderation easier for the server staff! |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings/customized bot behavior. |

### What data does T_Music_Bot collect?
As there is not much functionality to the bot yet, we do not really need to store any actual data.
We only store one basic thing to make sure that everything functions properly.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings and playlist settings. |
| Song Amount | We store how the number of songs each user has played.\n**This is only used to display information on the** `/topsongs` **and** `/topusers` **commands**

### Do we share our collected data with anyone?

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.

### I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it?

There are 3 main options available to delete your data.
- You can either contact the developer on Discord (TehPig_YT#9063) providing your User ID / Server ID. Once the developer is online, your data will be deleted as soon as possible!
- Join our Discord Support Server by using the `ssupport` command, go to `#general-support` and mention your current state and issue. You will get support in less than 5 minutes if support is online.
- Some of the settings already have an option to disable them/delete the stored data. If there is no option available, try the first 2 options mentioned above.
