> ## **What data does T_Music_Bot collect?**

You can check the table below to see the data that we collect.
We only store a few basic things to improve the overall experience.

| Collected Data | Usage & Purpose |
| :------------- | :----------: |
| Server IDs | Keeping track of saved server settings and playlist settings. |
| Song Amount | We store how the number of songs each user has played.<br>**This is only used to display information on the** `/topsongs` **and** `/topusers` **commands** |

<br>

> ## **Do we share our collected data with anyone?**

We do **NOT** share any of our user data, since we know how important privacy is for every one of us.
<br><br>
> ## **I want to delete all my data, how am I able to do it?**

There are **3 main options** available to delete your data.
- You can contact the bot developer on Discord (`TehPig_YT#9063`) providing your `User ID` or `Server ID`. Once the developer is online, your data will be deleted and you will be informed!
- Join our Discord Support Server by using the `ssupport` command, go to `#general-support` and mention your current state and issue. You will get support in less than 5 minutes if support is online.
- Some of the settings already have an option to disable them/delete the stored data. If there is no option available, try the first 2 options mentioned above.
